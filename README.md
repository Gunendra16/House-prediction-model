# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The model is built using Python and several libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from a popular house price dataset.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and other relevant attributes. Accurate house price predictions can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms
- `sizes`: Size of the house in square feet
- `zip_codes`: Zip code of the house location
- `house_price`: Target variable, the price of the house

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure your dataset is cleaned and preprocessed.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the provided script.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

### Example

```python
# Load dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess data
# (Your preprocessing steps here)

# Train model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data[['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sizes', 'zip_codes']]
y = data['house_price']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

## Model Training

The model training process involves:
1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Training a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression).
4. Evaluating the model's performance.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to determine its accuracy. Adjust hyperparameters and improve the model as needed.
